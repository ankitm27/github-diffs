> Collapse or expand diffs in pull requests for easier code review

### Motivation
> When [there is a large number of files in a PR](https://twitter.com/kamranahmedse/status/877154633264844801) it becomes difficult to get an overview or to find some specific files with all the files in PR stacked upon each other. This extension allows collapsing and expanding files so that you do not have to pound the innocent scrollbar.

### Sneak Peak

> Adds buttons to `Collapse all Diffs` or `Show all Diffs` and individual toggle diff options
